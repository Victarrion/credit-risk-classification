Module 20 Homework


This homework assignment revolved around regression. To complete this, I needed to use the dataset provided regarding risky bank loans and create a regression model that could predict is a loan was healthy or risky.

To do this, I created two models based on risky and healthy data as test models and 2 test models to train, name X and Y respectively.

##Results

Based on the results, the model was better at predicting healthy loans than risky ones:

However, I believe this is because the sample size is smaller on the risky loans than healthy. Being a real bank, we can assume it has stayed open and in bussiness by making good investments ant avoiding risk as this would put it out of bussiness.
